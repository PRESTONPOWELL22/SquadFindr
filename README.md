# SquadFindr

Project Proposal:

Purpose: To provide newly relocated individuals the ability to establish relationships through a one-stop shop app that allows them to e-generate sports teams/connections.

Users: Our users are adventurous, athletic, competitive and enthusiastic about meeting new people. They are primarily between the ages of 18-50. Often, they are new to their neighborhoods or very involved in their communities.

We will design a system that will take user information, including but not limited to:
Sport(s) of interest
Position(s) played in sport(s) of interest
Experience in these positions
Scheduled availability
Local region

The system shall:
Assign users to a team according to their submitted information
All team positions will be filled as fully as possible
Team experience will be normalized such that no team has significantly more experience than another
Schedule games between teams utilizing user/team availability
Select game location according to user location data
